hack BASIC:

A simple micro Basic implementation in the Jack language for the hack Computer.

EDITING AND LINE FORMATS
     1.  Line numbers must be between 1 and 32762 
     2.  Lines are appended and/or inserted 
     3.  Line number alone followed by C/R deletes the line 
     4.  Blanks are immaterial, except key words must contain no embedded blanks 
     5.  The system prompts with a "#" 
     6.  Multiple statement lines are not permitted 

COMMANDS
     1.  NEW     - Deletes all lines and data 
     2.  LIST    - Lists the program      
     3.  RUN     - Executes program consisting of the numbered statements 
     4.  Any line without a line number is executed immediately 
         Example: PRINT (47+56) *15 
     5.  A "Break" will terminate program execution and return to "#" 

INPUT/OUTPUT
     1.  INPUT Statement 
         A.  INPUT X
             System prompts with "?" on an input command 
             Entry of numbers out of the range Â± 32762 causes an error 
     2.  PRINT
         A.  PRINT  - Prints a blank line 
         B.  PRINT A,B,C
         C.  PRINT "LITERAL STRING"
         D.  PRINT A; "TIMES"; B; "EQUALS"; A*B
             A semicolon creates a single space between elements 
             whereas a comma is used for zone spacing. (See tab function) 
             A semicolon at the end of the print line suppresses C/R and LF 

VARIABLES 
 
     1.  26 Variable names A,B,C,D ....Z are allowed 
     2.  range +/- 32762 
     3.  No string variables (Strings can only be used in print statements) 
 
EXPRESSIONS 
 
         A.  X 
         B.  X+Y *(5-Z) 
         C.  (X+Y) * (X-Y)/(X * Y) 
         D.  Divide by zero causes error printout 
         E.  Abbreviated below as "EXPR" to show how statements work 
         F.  Double byte integer math only 
         G.  Overflow over/under + 31762 causes error on multiply and divide 
             no error on addition or subtraction overflow. 
 
ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS 
 
         A.  LET (VARIABLE)=EXPR 
             Examples: 
                 LET X = Y 
                 LET Y = 10+C 
                 LET A(10,X) = (X+Y)*5 - (Z+3)*50  
         B.  Can be implied  
             Example: 
                 Y = A*B + 1976 
 
RELATIONSHIP TEST 
 
         A.  IF EXPR (RELATIONSHIP) EXPR (STATEMENT)  
         B.  RELATIONSHIP can be: 
                  <, >, =, <>, ><, <=, >= 
         C.  Examples: 
                 IF X = Y GOTO 30 
                 IF X+5 = 2*Y-7 LET X=Y 
                 IF A <> B PRINT "WRONG" 
 
CONTROL STATEMENTS 
 
     1.  GOTO (EXPR)  
             Examples: 
                 GOTO 35 
                 GOTO R+50 

     2.  GOSUB (EXPR) 
             Examples: 
                 GOSUB 8000 
                 GOSUB Z*1000 

     3.  RETURN 
         A.  Must be preceded by a GOSUB 
     
     4.  FOR and NEXT 
         A.  FOR (VARIABLE) = (EXPR) TO (EXPR) 
         B.  Examples: 
              FOR J = 1 TO 20  
         C.  Step is 1 only 
         D.  FOR Loops can be nested 
         E.  Branching out of the loops without indexing the variable is not permitted due to stack control problems 

     5.  NEXT Variable: 
         A.  Examples: 
              NEXT J  
         B.  Indexes the FOR variable by one. 
 
FUNCTIONS 
 
     1.  TAB (EXPR) - Starts next print element at position specified by 
    EXPR 
    A.  Examples: 
            PRINT TAB (20); I; TAB (40); "YES" 
            PRINT TAB (X+5); "*"  
    B.  If print element is past point defined, printing starts at present print position 
 
    

ERROR MESSAGES
     1.  ERROR #______________ IN LINE #______________ 
          A.  If LINE # = 00000 error was in direct execution statement 
     2.  Error Codes: 
       1.  Input line over 72 characters 
       2.  Numeric overflow
